Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Economic growth is a very important concept in macroeconomics.
 It can be defined as the increase or improvement in the inflation-adjusted
 market value of the goods and services produced by an economy (also known
 as 
\shape italic
GDP
\shape default
) over a certain period of time.
 Since high economic growth would generally make a nation more prosperous,
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When we say high economic growth here, we are referring strictly to the
 amount of growth within an economy's capacity.
 When the economic growth is too rapid, the economy will start to 
\shape italic

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

overheat
\shape default
 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which will cause high rate of inflation, among many other undesirable
 effects
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which in turn would generally improve its citizens' standards of living.
 It is for this reason that in the modern history, increasing the rate of
 economic growth is almost the universal preoccupation of almost every country's
 government regardless of the form of governance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the rate of economic growth can vary quite widely from one year
 to the other, which poses a problem for government planning.
 Therefore, if we can predict the rate of economic growth, it would be undoubted
ly helpful for the government in terms of planning its government expenditure,
 taxation, etc.
 Currently, one of the most classic models that is used to predict long-run
 economic growth is the 
\series bold
Solow‚ÄìSwan model
\series default
 or 
\series bold
exogenous growth model.
 
\series default
Mathematically, this is an nonlinear system consisting of a single ordinary
 differential equation that models the evolution of the per capita stock
 of capital.
 In the following sections, I will firstly introduce the model before going
 on to explore the nonlinear dynamics of the system for two different versions
 of the model (with increasing complexity)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Here, it is important to keep in mind that the versions of model explored
 would not be exhaustive
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as well as trying to compare the model to some real-world data that I was
 able to collect online.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Solow-Swan model with AK technology and constant labour growth rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth mentioning before we go any further that we are measuring the
 rate of economic growth by rate of capital accumulation here.
 It is important to note that these two concepts are not the same yet they
 are still deeply connected in the sense that the accumulation of capital
 goods translates to investment and the production of more goods and services,
 which should boost the income of the population and stimulate demand.
 (In the other words, economic growth) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This version of the model is arguably the most basic form of the model,
 but it will serve as a basis for our investigation going forward.
 This version of the model is set up based on the following assumptions/conditio
ns:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Tbere is one good (
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}$
\end_inset

) produced by only one factor of production (
\begin_inset Formula $K_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 Therefore the resulting production function is 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}=F(K_{t})=AK_{t}$
\end_inset

, where A is an exogenous positive constant that represents the level of
 technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Saving is proportional to the aggregate income i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t}=sY_{t}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 denotes the exogeneous saving rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since the economy is closed, the change in the capital stock could be represente
d as 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula $K_{t}\prime$
\end_inset

 here is the same as 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$
\backslash
dot{K
\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

, representing differentiation with respect to time
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $K_{t}\prime=sY_{t}-ùõøK_{t}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõø$
\end_inset

 is the rate of depreciation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the context of the model, we consider population = labour.
 That is to say that 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\frac{L\prime_{t}}{L_{t}}$
\end_inset

, the constant population growth rate would equate to labour growth rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we are more interested in per-capita terms, we define a new variable
 called the 
\series bold
capital-labour ratio
\series default
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}=\frac{K_{t}}{L_{t}}$
\end_inset

.
 Then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{k_{t}\prime}{k_{t}}=\frac{K_{t}\prime}{K_{t}}-\frac{L_{t}\prime}{L_{t}}$
\end_inset

.
 Then by some simple calculations that I would omit here, we get: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{t}\prime=(N-n)k_{t},N\equiv sA-ùõø
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This first order differential equation in 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the fundamental equation of the Solow-Swan model with a production function
 which is linear in physical capital.
 From this equation, we can plot the evolution of the capital of stock with
 respect to time as shown in Figure 1 when the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $(N-n)$
\end_inset

 takes different signs.
 We can notice that: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For 
\begin_inset Formula $N=n$
\end_inset

, regardless the initial condition, steady state has
\series bold
 zero growth
\series default
 in per-worker capital stock
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For 
\begin_inset Formula $N<n$
\end_inset

, we notice negative growth throughout, and the economy will converge in
 the long-run to a per-worker capital stock equal to zero
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For 
\begin_inset Formula $N>n,$
\end_inset

we notice positive growth throughout, and the economy will approach an infinitel
y large level of per-worker capital stock in the long run
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, the third senario will be the most favourable for an economy.
 When we translate the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $N>n$
\end_inset

 into plain english, it will state that the savings rate (adjusted by the
 level of technology,
\begin_inset Formula $sA$
\end_inset

) minus the depreciation rate of physical capital (
\begin_inset Formula $ùõø$
\end_inset

) should be greater than the constant population growth rate (
\begin_inset Formula $n).$

\begin_layout Section
The Solow-Swan model with AK technology and logistic labour growth rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we are going to be modifying the model for population growth
 to complicate things a little bit.
 The problem that we had with constant labour growth rate before is that
 population would grow exponentially without any constraint.
 Namely, the solution to 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\frac{L\prime_{t}}{L_{t}}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{t}=L_{0}*e^{nt}$
\end_inset

.
 Obviously, this model of population growth would not be realistic, which
 is the reason why we are introducing the logistic equation for labour/populatio
n growth:
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This population growth model is discussed in depth at Page 22 in Strogatz.
 To save the repetitiveness, I will just summarize the results here.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{L_{t}\prime}{L_{t}}=n-bL_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is population growth rate as usual, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is a constant satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $n-bL_{t}>0$
\end_inset

.
 This equation can also be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{L_{t}\prime}{L_{t}}=n(1-\frac{L_{t}}{ùêä})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $ùêä$
\end_inset

 denotes 
\series bold
carrying capacity
\series default
.
 (i.e., the maximum population size of a biological species that can be sustained
 by that specific environment.) Instead of solving this differential equation
 analytically, we plot 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{t}\prime$
\end_inset

 against 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{t}$
\end_inset

 like we have done many times as shown in Figure 2.

This figure shows that no matter where the population starts from, the populatio
n converges eventually to the carry capacity as t goes to infinity.
 (In the other words, K in the graph is a stable fixed point.) Therefore,
 incorporating the symbols and equations that we have introduced a bit earlier,
 we get the following system of equation to represent the AK technology
 model with logistic labour growth rate: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{cases}
k_{t}\prime & =\left[N-(n-bL_{t})\right]k_{t}\\
L_{t}\prime & =L_{t}(n-bL_{t})
\end{cases}(*)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where if we are given the initial condition 
\begin_inset Formula $(k_{0}>0,L_{0}>0)$
\end_inset

 we can get a unique solution 
\begin_inset Formula $(k_{t},L_{t})$
\end_inset

.
 In the next section, we are going to investigate the steady state (see
 the definition a bit later) and some of the dynamics of the model after
 we made the switch to the logistic labour growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Steady state and dynamics of model with logistic labour growth rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start off by defining what is the steady state of the model.
 A steady state in an economy refers to the situation where the growth of
 population/labour and per capita physical capital are both zero.
 After reading this definition, it is natural to make a connection with
 something we learned early on in class.
 And yes indeed, steady state in this context is just a fancier name for
 fixed point of two-dimension system.
 
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For more detailed discussion on this, please refer to Section 6.3 in Strogatz.
\end_layout

\end_inset

We denote the steady state values of this system as 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{*}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 From the first glance, it is evident that 
\begin_inset Formula $(k_{t},L_{t})=(0,0)$
\end_inset

 is always a fixed point.
 However, in this context, we will 
\series bold
disregard
\series default
 this solution as this is economically meaningless.
 After all, who would like to study the dynamics of an economy that has
 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 workers in it ? We would probably be better off spending our time elsewhere.
 After excluding this not-so-exciting solution, we have another pair of
 solution that satisfies: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{cases}
Nk_{t} & =0\\
n-bL_{t} & =0
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving this system of the equation, we see that if 
\begin_inset Formula $N\neq0$
\end_inset

, we wouldn't obtain any non-trivial steady state as the only way to satisfy
 the first equation is to make 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}=0$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, we see that if 
\begin_inset Formula $N=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}$
\end_inset

 can take on any value to satisfy the first equation and along with 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{t}=\frac{n}{b}$
\end_inset

, a non-trivial fixed point could be obtained.
 To summarize, the economy has 
\series bold
no
\series default
 steady state when 
\begin_inset Formula $N\neq0$
\end_inset

 and has 
\series bold
infinite
\series default
 stead state when 
\begin_inset Formula $N=0$
\end_inset

.
 Now, the legitimate question that we can ask ourselves is that what kind
 of fixed point do we have when 
\begin_inset Formula $N\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 To find out, we employ linearization: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{dk_{t}'}{dk_{t}} & \frac{dk_{t}'}{dL_{t}}\\
\frac{dL_{t}'}{dk_{t}} & \frac{dL_{t}'}{dL_{t}}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
N-n+bL_{t} & bk_{t}\\
0 & n-2bL_{t}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
N & bk_{t}\\
0 & -n
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

To look for the eigenvalue, set the determinant to zero at the fixed point
 
\begin_inset Formula $(k_{t},L_{t}=\frac{n}{b})$
\end_inset

: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
det\left[\begin{array}{cc}
N-\lambda & bk_{t}\\
0 & -n-\lambda
\end{array}\right]=0
\]

\end_inset

which gives: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(N-\lambda)(-n-\lambda)=0;(N-\lambda)(n+\lambda)=0
\]

\end_inset

Then, we have two eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=-n$
\end_inset

.
 In the other word, depending on the signs of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-n$
\end_inset

, we will have either saddle, unstable, stable node locally around the steady
 state (fixed point).
 These are all hyperbolic points, so according to the 
\shape italic
Hartman-Grobman Theory

\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For more detailed discussion on this, please refer to page 156 in Strogatz.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, our use of linearization to determine the stability of steady state is
 justified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Remark
\shape default
: Even though theoretically we can take any value for the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(N,n)$
\end_inset

 as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $N\neq0$
\end_inset

, we would typically want to take both as positive in reality.
 If one recalls the definition from an earlier section, the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 represents population/labour growth rate, which has the range 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq\frac{L_{t}'}{L_{t}}\leq n-bL_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 This range confirms what we are observing in the real world.

 With this observation, this fixed point would be either a stable node or
 saddle point.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From system 
\begin_inset Formula $(*)$
\end_inset

 from the last section, we can solve for the explicit expression of 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{t}=k_{0}e^{\intop_{0}^{t}(N-\frac{L_{t}'}{L_{t}})dt}=\frac{k_{0}L_{0}e^{Nt}}{L_{t}}(**)
\]

\end_inset

 However, from the equation we got under the expoential population growth
 rate assumption: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{t}\prime=(N-n)k_{t}
\]

\end_inset

We can also solve 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}$
\end_inset

 to have the same expression as 
\begin_inset Formula $(**)$
\end_inset

.
 That is an interesting observation, meaning that even under our new population
 growth assumption, the path of per-worker capital is still the same.
 In particular, given the positive initial condition 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{0}>0;L_{0}>0$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}$
\end_inset

 negatively on the population/labour size 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{t}$
\end_inset

 at time t.

 some fixed amount of particle in increasing larger quantity of solutions
 (dilution).

We finish this section can make some simple observations on the relationship
 between the economic growth (
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{k_{t}'}{k_{t}})$
\end_inset

 and net adjusted saving rate (N).
 For simplicity define 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{k_{t}'}{k_{t}}\equiv\gamma_{k_{t}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{L_{t}'}{L_{t}}\equiv\gamma_{L_{t}}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that we have the following from the first equation of the system(*):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{t}\prime=\left[N-(n-bL_{t})\right]k_{t}=[N-\frac{L_{t}'}{L_{t}}]k_{t}=[N-\gamma_{L_{t}}]k_{t}
\]

\end_inset

Rearranging terms to get: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma_{k_{t}}=N-\gamma_{L_{t}}
\]

\end_inset

With this we have the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $N=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{k_{t}}=-\gamma_{L_{t}}<0$
\end_inset

.
 The last inequality sign is from the range that is given earlier in the
 section.
 Therefore, if 
\begin_inset Formula $N=0$
\end_inset

, we will have negative economic growth.
 However, as 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, economic growth would tend to zero.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We can see from Figure 3 shown above that the population growth tends to
 flatten out.
 In the context of logistic population growth model, this happens when the

 Therefore, if

Solow growth model in real life
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With all these above being said, one might want very naturally that whether
 the economic growth in the real life can be predicted to some degree of
 accuracy by the basic Solow model described above.
 That is precisely what we are going to investigate in this section.
 From the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $(**)$
\end_inset

 that we obtained in the previous section, we see that the value 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}$
\end_inset

 will increase as the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$
\end_inset

 increases.
 However, as 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}\equiv sA-ùõø$
\end_inset

, we can derive that the value 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}$
\end_inset

 increases as saving's rate (
\begin_inset Formula $s)$
\end_inset

 increases.
 In the same expression, we also see that as the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{t}$
\end_inset

 increases, the value 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}$
\end_inset

 would decrease.
 Equivalently, we can say that the value 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{t}$
\end_inset

 decreases as the population growth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 increases.
 Recall that at the very beginning, we assumed that we are using so-called
 
\series bold
AK Technology production function
\series default
 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}=F(K_{t})=AK_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}$
\end_inset

 in this equation is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}$
\end_inset

 would also have the same relationship with respect to saving's rate (
\begin_inset Formula $s)$
\end_inset

 and population growth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $(n)$
\end_inset

.
 In summary: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Income 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}$
\end_inset

 (therefore income per capita) is 
\series bold
increasing

 in the saving's rate

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
The above two relationships given by the Solow model are what we are going
 to test on the real-life dataset.
 Before jumping into the testing, there is one remark to be made regarding
 to the saving's rate (
\begin_inset Formula $s)$
\end_inset

: due to the difficulties that I encountered in getting saving's rate 
\begin_inset Formula $(s)$
\end_inset

 statistics for different countries online, this parameter would be replaced
 by the percentage of GDP a country spends in investment.
 In fact, this choice is justified as it has been shown

 Firstly, I plotted Average percentage of country's GDP spent on investment
 over the 19 years vs Average GDP per capita over the 19 years (on the left).

 From the graph, we can see the points follow approximately the prediction
 given by the model in that there is a weak positive correlation between
 the percentage of GDP spent in investment and GDP per capita in this time
 period if we just exclude some outliers such as Luxembourg.
 Then secondly, I plotted Average population growth rate over the 19 years
 vs.
 Average GDP per capita over the 19 years (on the right).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As one can see from the line fitted in the graph, we have exactly the reverse
 as what the model would predict: we see higher GDP per capita for countries
 that have the most rapid population growth rate.
 Even though this situation is not completely unexpected especially given
 the simplicity of the model that we investigated here, we would at least
 expect that the model gives the approximately correct qualitative predictions,
 which once again doesn't seem to be the case for the second assumption/plot.
 In the next section, I will attempt to give some plausible explanations
 into why this seemingly ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù conclusion raised.

\begin_layout Section
Limitations of the simple Solow growth model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, I will attempt to analyze why especially the second graph
 produced seemingly completely incorrect conclusions with respect to the
 model prediction.
 Firstly, this discrepancy may stem from the fact that we used population
 growth rate data instead of labour population growth rate data.
 The reason why I chose to use general population growth data here is due
 to the scarcity of the statistics on labour population growth rate as well
 as the assumption that we used throughout this report that labour population
 and general population can be considered the same.
 It is not unimaginable that a country's labour force grows slower than
 that country's population growth due to factors such as aging population
 accompanied by better healthcare.
 That is actually the case for the US economy where during the next 10 years
 the labour force is projected to grow 0.5 percent annually, slower than
 the 0.8-percent annual growth projected for the population.

 Therefore, it is entirely possible in this context that countries such
 as Luxembourg experiences slower labour population growth while having
 the highest general percentage of population growth over the last twenty
 years.
 Therefore, the assumptions that we had about labour population = general
 population might have to be reconsidered if we are to seek a more reliable
 and accurate result from the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, Solow's growth model is established on the theory of a closed
 economy (as indicated in the second section), which simply means that a
 group of nations does not have any kind of relationship.
 In the case that we are considering here about 27 current EU member states,
 this assumption could not have been more inaccurate.
 One of the defining characteristics of the European Union is that these
 27 member states form an Economic Union, meaning that the member states
 have both common policies on product regulation, freedom of movement of
 goods, services and the factors of production (capital and labour) and
 a common external trade policy.
 Therefore, just on the contrary of the assumption, these 27 countries considere
d might just have closer economic ties with each other than any other countries
 in the world.
 On this basis, I would imagine that if we do the same thing on more isolated
 economies such as these in sub-Sahara Africa, we would get closer results
 to the prediction than what we currently have.
 However, just to be fair to Solow, when he first proposed his model back
 in the 1950s, a time that largely predated the creation of international
 trade associations such as WTO (1995), he probably hardly imagined that
 the global economy nowadays would be so closely intertwined.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thirdly, in the third assumption that we presented in the second section,
 we have the following equation: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K_{t}\prime=sY_{t}-ùõøK_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implicitly, this equation doesn't differentiate between human capitals (skills
 acquired through schooling, training, practice, and socialization) and
 physical capital (tools, machinery, structures employed by human beings
 as means of production).
 As their names suggest, these two kinds of capitals are very different
 hence it would be extremely misleading to model the depreciation of both
 using a single 
\begin_inset Formula $Œ¥$
\end_inset

 .
 Sometimes physical capital can be lost or damaged in ways that human capitals
 cannot: as long as a company manages to retain its personnel, the company's
 investment in human capital would be secure since the human capital lies
 in personnel's capabilities and skills; on the other hand, even if a company
 manages to keep its machinery, they might be subjected to damage or lost
 hence replacement.
 The difference that I just mentioned is one of the many differences between
 human and physical capital.
 The key takeaway is that not differentiating between those two would in
 some ways make this model impractical.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we see from the last section, there are severe limitations to the Solow
 growth model, which might explain partially the discrepancies we observe
 when plotting the real world data.
 Admittedly, we can add many further terms to the existing Solow model in
 the hope of capturing as many variables as possible while sticking to realistic
 assumptions.
 However, since economics is such an inherently complex and unpredictable
 subject, there will never be a perfect model.
 I think the lesson that we can take from analyzing this model is that the
 point of models such as that of Solow's is not to capture accurately every
 single detail of the real world; instead, the main point is for it to provide
 us with some qualitative understandings of the complex world.
